"Be liberal in what you accept, and conservative in what you send" - Jon Postel
"A change in perspective is worth 80 IQ points." - Alan Kay
"Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes." - Edsger Dijkstra
"Simplicity does not precede complexity but follows it" - Alan Perlis
"There are two ways to write error-free programs; only the third one works." - Alan Perlis
"Programmers are optimistic. And we have to be because if we weren’t optimists we couldn’t do this work. Which is why we fall prey to things like second systems, why we can’t schedule our projects, why this stuff is so hard." - Douglas Crockford
"I think an hour of code reading is worth two weeks of QA." - Douglas Crockford
"As they say, it’s easier to optimize correct code than to correct optimized code." - Joshua Bloch
"There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. The first method is far more difficult." - Tony Hoare
"Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to show their absence!" - Edsger Dijkstra
